Dedicated to the memory of [Frits Holm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frits_Holm),
aka The Duke of Colachine aka The Prince of Colachine; "collector", adventurer, fraud, imposter. 

Travelling to China at the dawn of the 20th century, Holm ventured to "purchase"
(steal) the famous Nestorian Monolith, an early record of Christianity in China.
As the workers Holm hired struggled to move the artifact, the Chinese government
reacted by taking it and placing it in one of their museums.

Thwarted in his plans, the Duke of the nonexistent Duchy of Colachine decided
instead of create a copy of the item, and ship it to New York, with the plan
of selling it to the Metropolitan Museum. 

The New York press lauded "Count Fritz Von Holm, a relative of the Danish King"
on his triumphal arrival with the two-ton monolith. Unfortunately, Sir Purdon
Clarke, director of the Metropolitan Museum said that, “the stone has little
value as an art object.” In the end Holm had to settle for lending the item to
the museum. Source: (Keevak, 2008)

Holm's adventures do end on a happy note, when he married Marguerite MacDonough Green,
only child of Warren L. Green, president of the American Bank Note Company, with
an estate valued at around $1,000,000. (Pearce, 2020)

He died of pneumonia in 1930 because he refused to wear an overcoat. (NYT, 1930)
